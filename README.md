# VCCA workshop 2020
Raw materials for a workshop on infrastructure and open science at the Virtual Conference on Computational Audiology (VCCA), june 19th, 2020.

The talk refers to a number of pages and publications with a short description here:

# https://www.practicereproducibleresearch.org/
A consise piece of work on reproducible science. I've taken the liberty to ask participants what the greates hurdle for open science is, based on the 'pain points' descibed in chapter 5(https://www.practicereproducibleresearch.org/core-chapters/5-lessons.html)

# How long does it take to reproduce a figure from a paper three years back:
As it turns out, it is approximately 280 hours. If you are an expert or the author. Otherwise it is not reproducible

# Repeatability of published microarray gene expression analyses.
If you'd repeat some of the highest impact papers, how many of the are reproducible?
Two analyses could be reproduced in principle and six partially or with some discrepancies; ten could not
be reproduced. The main reason for failure to reproduce was data unavailability, and discrepancies were related to incomplete data annotation or specification of data processing and analysis in the original papers.
